        body:`<h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
        <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
        I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
        projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
         While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was 
         learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
         <h3>How I got started</h3>
         <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
          take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
           use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
            summaries of what I learned using my own words. That helped me grok
             what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries
              was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
