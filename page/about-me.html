                <h3 class="about-me-inside">What got me started in coding</h3>
                <p class="about-me-inside">I've always loved technology in every form, and coding was something that just excited me. 
                    There is something so captivating about the ability to create things for anything you might need.
                    My goals have always been to learn and create things that have real everyday use to make the 
                    lives easier for the people I know (even those I don't).</p>
                <h3 class="about-me-inside">What motivates me</h3>
                <p class="about-me-inside">I got a drive to understand how things work and a desire to create my own things. Family is
                   another huge factor, you wouldn't be reading this text if it wasn't for them and I'm lucky to have them.
